      <description>**This article was written for my employer Jump24, you can read the original source article .
My start at Jump24 was never going to be straightforward – the United Kingdom was in full COVID-19 lockdown, bringing down tech meetups and conferences worldwide at the point when I was fully launching into a Developer Relations role, which would immediately have to be redefined to make our developer outreach work. But: we currently have a talk and live code demo session currently on tour – so how did we do it, and what experience have we gained?</description>

      <title>A Fifth Pillar of Developer Relations</title>

      <description>I don&amp;rsquo;t think anyone could have predicted how bad 2020 would end up, but it certainly brought to light some thinking about how I&amp;rsquo;d like Developer Relations to change.
There is a specific reason for writing this article, but I realised that the topic it covered went a lot deeper, and exposes new trends in tech while raising some fairly important questions to consider both in Developer Relations and Web Development.</description>

      <title>Turbocharged PHP Development with Xdebug, Docker &amp; PHPStorm</title>

      <description>**This article was written for my employer Jump24, you can read the original source article here.
It all started out with that oh-so-modern cause of a community backlash: the humble tweet.

Quite the controversial “hot-take” from Derick, and while it certainly caused quite the stir (that it was probably designed to), it made me think. I thought, ‘Do I need to revisit Xdebug?’, and I realised that I’d fallen into Derick’s trap.</description>

      <title>Virtual onboarding during the COVID-19 crisis - time costing</title>

      <description>Almost every tech company is facing unprecedented challenges during the COVID-19 crisis, and at Jump24 it’s been no exception. The tech world has been switched to fully virtual overnight, which is bringing some very interesting debates forward (that I will discuss), most notably “how well is your business currently designed to deal with that?”
I would argue that one of the biggest indicators of how well you’re set up to deal with this is onboarding new staff.</description>

      <title>Talk - The Politics of Tool Shaming</title>

      <description>Most of us have heard it at some point. &amp;ldquo;WHAT? You use X framework/tool/OS/language?! So&amp;hellip; you&amp;rsquo;re a bad developer then?&amp;rdquo;
I did not come from a Software Development background into this industry. I was an outsider, but it&amp;rsquo;s what I wanted to do my whole life. This is my story: how I refocused and retrained in my career to be confronted with a nightmare of gatekeeping, elistism and aggression. I saw what I thought was a problem, and I&amp;rsquo;d like to propose a solution.</description>

      <description>Most backend developers know about interactive modes, that certainly isn’t a secret.
jimseconde@jim-amd-u18$: php -a
jimseconde@jim-amd-u18$: node
jimseconde@jim-amd-u18$: python3
All give you an active interpreter for that respective language. It’s used mostly for testing or confirming behaviour on the fly - ironically because you have a mountain of code in the middle of your app, your linter isn’t picking up on anything suspicious and exceptions are being thrown where you don’t want.</description>

“Right, what are we going to use&amp;hellip;Sentry? Pagerduty? Have we got an account? What do you mean, we’ve not set up auto-scaling groups? OK, have we got time to create them instead of manually spinning up AMI EC2s?”
Black Friday has had a very patchy impact in the UK on the high street over the last decade, but where it is undoubtedly having the most influence is in the world of ecommerce - where the territory market restrictions are removed.</description>
