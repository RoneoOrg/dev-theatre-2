      <description>**This article was written for my employer Jump24, you can read the original source article .
My start at Jump24 was never going to be straightforward – the United Kingdom was in full COVID-19 lockdown, bringing down tech meetups and conferences worldwide at the point when I was fully launching into a Developer Relations role, which would immediately have to be redefined to make our developer outreach work. But: we currently have a talk and live code demo session currently on tour – so how did we do it, and what experience have we gained?</description>

      <description>I don&amp;rsquo;t think anyone could have predicted how bad 2020 would end up, but it certainly brought to light some thinking about how I&amp;rsquo;d like Developer Relations to change.
There is a specific reason for writing this article, but I realised that the topic it covered went a lot deeper, and exposes new trends in tech while raising some fairly important questions to consider both in Developer Relations and Web Development.</description>
