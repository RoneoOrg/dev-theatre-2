I've been meaning to do this for ages, so I'm going to release a couple of specials for the Dev Radio.

It's probably my favourite fact that my last ever (hopefully) DJ gig was my best mates' wedding at a club venue in Ibiza.
It was also hands-down my favourite gig I did. The crowd loved it and it was a joy to perform. I say 'perform',
because Sion, Chris and I put a hell of a lot of effort into it. We did verbal crate-digging about what sound they
wanted - this wasn't just me "doing a wedding gig" and dropping Chas and Dave.

When trying to be super-cool all the time behind the decks, it had never crossed my mind to do something like this. What made
this such fun was that (as you can see from the tracklisting) every single track and drop is a cheesy crowd pleasing banger. The 
reaction was pretty much what you'd expect.

There's also a scattering of samples and even some mashups, which were also all done live. It was exhausting to do live.

If you're wondering: the intro is a minute of years of shared friendship and in-jokes.

It was also recorded. Enjoy.
